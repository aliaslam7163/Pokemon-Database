############################################### Why build the project in Angular? ####################################

During my call with William, he had mentioned few of the firm's projects were developed using Angular. Having this information, it made sense to display my ability to get a task done in Angular as well.

The project uses interfaces, an OOP technique. I also deviated from using a server database. This was mainly because, we can easily read a JSON file and do mapping on the file using Angular's Http client.

This choice avoids the task of handing off private DB or server information within a config file either it be a mysql DB or a backend as service such as firebase.
